'Ancient Egyptian Music - Tomb of the Ancients' by Fantasy & World Music by the Fiechters on YouTube
* This audio file is a compilation of several Egyptian pieces created by the same two brothers. Their music is open source, as stated in their channel's [About Page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjMZjGhrFq_4llVS_x2XJ_w/about). We used samples from two of the tracks in this compilation for our game audio, 'Hathor' and 'Bastet'.
